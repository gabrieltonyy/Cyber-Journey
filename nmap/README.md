# Nmap Learning Guide

Welcome to the **Nmap Learning Guide**, a comprehensive, step-by-step repository designed to help you master Nmap's core capabilities through clear documentation, hands-on exercises, and real-world applications. Whether you're new to network security or enhancing your reconnaissance skills, this guide breaks down Nmap into five essential phases:

## 📚 Learning Phases

### 1. **[Host Discovery](docs/host_discovery.md)**  
   Detect which systems are alive on your network using multiple discovery techniques, understand network topology, and build target inventories efficiently.

### 2. **[Port Scanning](docs/port_scanning.md)**  
   Determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered using various scan types, optimize performance, and understand firewall behavior.

### 3. **[Version/Service Detection](docs/version_service_detection.md)**  
   Identify running services and their exact software versions, perform SSL/TLS security assessment, and map vulnerabilities to specific software.

### 4. **[OS Fingerprinting](docs/os_fingerprinting.md)**  
   Determine the target's operating system, device type, and network characteristics through advanced TCP/IP stack analysis.

### 5. **[Further Probing](docs/further_probing.md)**  
   Master the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), implement advanced evasion techniques, and perform comprehensive security assessments.

## 🔧 Quick Reference

### **[Complete Command Cheat Sheet](docs/cheat_sheet.md)**
Comprehensive reference covering all Nmap commands, flags, timing options, NSE scripts, and real-world usage examples. Perfect for quick lookups and exam preparation.

## 🧪 Hands-On Learning

### **[Comprehensive Laboratory](labs/comprehensive_lab.md)**
Structured lab exercises that guide you through:
- Multi-method network discovery
- Performance optimization techniques  
- Stealth scanning and evasion
- Vulnerability assessment workflows
- Professional reporting and analysis

## 📋 What You'll Learn

### **Conceptual Mastery**
- Network reconnaissance methodology
- TCP/IP protocol behavior analysis
- Security assessment techniques
- Firewall and IDS evasion strategies

### **Practical Skills**  
- Command-line expertise with 200+ Nmap options
- NSE script utilization for vulnerability detection
- Performance tuning for large-scale networks
- Integration with security workflows and automation

### **Real-World Applications**
- Penetration testing reconnaissance
- Vulnerability management
- Network asset inventory
- Compliance assessment
- Security monitoring and baseline establishment

## 🛠️ Advanced Integration

### **Netcat (Ncat) as a Complementary Tool**

While this guide focuses on Nmap's automated discovery and scanning capabilities, there are scenarios requiring **interactive analysis**, **manual verification**, or **custom protocols**. That's where **Netcat (Ncat)** becomes invaluable:

- **Manual banner grabbing** for mis-identified services
- **Custom protocol testing** and application interaction  
- **Port connectivity verification** in scripted workflows
- **File transfers** and **reverse shell techniques** in penetration testing
- **Proxy chaining** and **traffic tunneling** for advanced scenarios

Throughout the documentation, you'll find "Netcat Tips" that demonstrate seamless integration between Nmap's automated reconnaissance and Netcat's hands-on capabilities.
